# LLMChat
Chatbots developed during my time at SitScape. These are proof of concept chatbots the return precise answers to user inquiries based on pdf input within the 'docs' folder.   

The script titled "Qdrant&Faiss.py" allows the user to specify which vector database they would like to use. "LLMChat.py" allows you to select which LLM to use via the command line. You are able to change the desired LLM within the code of Qdrant&Faiss, however.
